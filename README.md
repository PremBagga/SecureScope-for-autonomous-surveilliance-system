# 🚨 *SecureScope Autonomous Surveillance System* 🛡👁

## 🌟 *Project Overview* 🚀

Welcome to *SecureScope* – an advanced *autonomous surveillance system* that leverages *AI* and *machine learning (ML)* to deliver *real-time video monitoring* and *intelligent analysis*. This system detects suspicious activities, performs facial recognition, and sends instant alerts—powered by a sleek and intuitive web interface.

## 🔑 *Key Features*:

- 🎥 *Real-time Surveillance Streaming*: Stream live video and detect objects in real-time.
- 🤖 *Autonomous Object Tracking*: Track moving objects automatically in the camera's field of view.
- 🧑‍⚖ *Facial Recognition*: Recognize and track individuals from your surveillance footage.
- 📲 *Real-time Alerts*: Receive instant notifications for suspicious activities or unauthorized individuals.
- 🧠 *Machine Learning Integration*: Continuously enhances detection accuracy through machine learning algorithms.
- 🔒 *Data Encryption*: Securely store all surveillance data with encryption to ensure privacy.
- 🖥 *User Interface*: A sleek, responsive web-based interface for smooth monitoring and control.

---

## 🛠 *Technologies Used*:

### 💻 *Frontend*:
- *HTML, **CSS, **JavaScript* – To create a dynamic and interactive user interface and live video streaming.
- *Bootstrap* – For a mobile-responsive and sleek frontend design.

### 🔙 *Backend*:
- *Python* – Flask/Django for handling server-side logic and video processing.
- *OpenCV* – For real-time object detection and tracking.
- *TensorFlow* & *Keras* – For implementing machine learning models for facial recognition and behavior analysis.
- *SQLite* / *PostgreSQL* – For secure and structured data storage.

## ⚙ *How It Works*:

SecureScope utilizes *live video feeds* processed by machine learning algorithms to *detect objects, **recognize faces, and **identify suspicious activities*. The system analyzes the footage in real-time, sending alerts whenever an anomaly is detected.

---

### 🛠 *Basic Workflow*:

1. *📹 Video Feed*: Stream live footage from your surveillance cameras.
2. *🔍 Object Detection*: ML algorithms automatically detect and track objects in real-time.
3. *🧑‍⚖ Facial Recognition*: Compares faces in the video to a database of known individuals.
4. *⚠ Anomaly Detection*: Detects abnormal behaviors or events that deviate from the norm.
5. *🚨 Real-time Alerts*: Instantly notifies users via email or message when suspicious behavior is detected.

---

## 🚦 *Getting Started*:

### 📋 *Prerequisites*:

Ensure the following are installed on your machine:
- *Python 3.x* 🐍
- *pip* (Python's package installer) 📦
- *Node.js* 💻 (For frontend dependencies)
- *Git* 🔧 (For version control)

---

### 🔧 *Installation Steps*:

#### 1. *Clone the repository*:
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SecureScope.git
cd SecureScope


#### 2. *Set up Python environment*:
Next, create a virtual environment for Python:
bash
python -m venv venv


Activate the virtual environment:
- *On Windows*:
  bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  
- *On macOS/Linux*:
  bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  

#### 3. *Install Python dependencies*:
Install all necessary Python libraries with the following command:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


#### 4. *Set up the frontend*:
Install Node.js dependencies to set up the frontend:
bash
npm install


#### 5. *Start the server*:
Start the Python server to launch the system:
bash
python app.py


#### 6. *Access the system*:
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to start using *SecureScope*.
